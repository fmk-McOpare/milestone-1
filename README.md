             CRYSTAL GUEST HOUSE
This Air B&B website is built with HTML and CSS within the confines of my knowledge in the web development industry. It is designed to give our valued visitors /users who will use this Guest House the optimum services befitting that of five-star hotel. It worth stating that this is not a 5-star hotel but rather it is Guest House that aims to provide a 5 star-like services to the customers. The Guest House has only 7 rooms with a small compound but the superfluous inner luxury makes up for its restricted external compound.
 INTRODUCTION
The driving force behind why I chose to design a GUEST HOUSE as my first website is that, over the years I have realised that smaller hotels lack certain qualities such as:
•	Inability to maintain the initial standard set by the hotels in its inception
•	Lack of proper security apparatus that gives the users their piece of mind during their stay in the hotel.
•	Lack of proper website designed for such smaller hotels
•	Lack of proper hotel management system in place for the smaller hotels.
•	Lack of proper platform for customer reviews 

OBJECTIVES
MY objectives are derived from the areas in the hotel industry that need improvement especially the small hotels in the system that lack maintenance

 culture and a touch of modernisation. CRYSTAL GUEST HOUSE would be built with a modernized features and an eye to improve on certain setbacks of small hotels in the systems by providing and improving on the following areas:
•	Provision of good service to our customers with the ultimate aim of ensuring that there is no dip in our standard since its inception. We hope to achieve this by using our modernised Hotel Management System.
•	Provision of a modernised website that present a vivid picture of the facilities in the Guest House that reflex the true facilities within the it. This would be supported with rooms setup, pictures and the entire landscape pictures of the Guest House.
•	Provision of platform for customer reviews and the willingness to attend to those reviews that calls for immediate fix that would help us maintain our standard.
•	We therefore welcome both good and bad reviews since it would help us to improve on our short falls.
The sketch below gives an insight to how the website would be structured. The website would be built purely with HTML which would help our structural formation and the CSS that would help to add some styles to the structure. I also aim to make this website a responsive one to be user friendly to different types of screens, ranging from monitors to mobile devices.
Should anybody find any left outs in this project please do not hesitate to notify me for immediate rectification. 
Please see the wireframe below to see how the website would be structure.
